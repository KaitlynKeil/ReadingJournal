There are [several differences](https://blog.appdynamics.com/devops/the-key-differences-between-python-2-and-python-3/) between Python 2 and 3, but the main one that comes up in this chapter is that '''print''' is a normal function (with parentheses) in Python 3 instead of a special statement. The rest of the concepts you read about in this chapter are also available in Python 2.7.\n",
